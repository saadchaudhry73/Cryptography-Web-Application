# Cryptography Web Application

## Introduction
*Cryptography Web Application* is your go-to destination for exploring the fascinating world of cryptography right from your browser. Whether you're a cryptography enthusiast, a student learning about encryption techniques, or a professional seeking secure communication solution, Crypto Web has something for everyone. Crypto Web is a web application designed to provide users with tools for encrypting and decrypting messages using various ciphers.

## Tools Used in this Project
- Encryption Tools
- Decryption Utilities
- Secure Communication
- Educational Resources
- Community Forum

## Requirement
- **Plain Text Message Input Field:** Users can enter their plain text message into the input field labeled "Plain Text Message".
- **Coding Mechanism Dropdown:** Users can select the desired cipher from the dropdown menu labeled "Coding Mechanism". Options include "Caesar" and "Morse".
- **Encrypt/Decrypt Buttons:** Users can click the "Encrypt Message" button to encrypt their message or the "Decrypt Message" button to decrypt it.
- **Result Message Display:** The result of the encryption or decryption process is displayed in the text area labeled "Result Message".
- **Encryption/Decryption Toggle Switch:** Users can switch between encryption and decryption modes using the toggle switch labeled "Encryption/Decryption".

## Encrypting a Message:
1. Enter the plain text message into the "Plain Text Message" input field.
2. Select the desired cipher from the "Coding Mechanism" dropdown.
3. Click the "Encrypt Message" button.
4. The encrypted message will be displayed in the "Result Message" text area.

## Decrypting a Message:
1. Enter the encrypted message into the "Plain Text Message" input field.
2. Select the corresponding cipher used for encryption from the "Coding Mechanism" dropdown.
3. Click the "Decrypt Message" button.
4. The decrypted message will be displayed in the "Result Message" textarea.

## Customization:
- Additional ciphers can be added to the "Coding Mechanism" dropdown by modifying the HTML code.
- Further styling and customization can be applied by editing the CSS file (`styles.css`).
- Additional functionality can be implemented by modifying the JavaScript file (`script.js`).

## Security Considerations
Crypto Web uses client-side encryption and decryption, which means sensitive data may be vulnerable if not handled properly. It is recommended to use secure encryption algorithms and follow best practices for data security when deploying Crypto Web in production environments.

## Conclusion
Crypto Web provides a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting messages using various ciphers. With its simple yet powerful features, Crypto Web is a valuable tool for anyone interested in exploring the world of cryptography.
